# python-blockchain

Make sure you turn on ENV mode
`python3 -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`
check that it's on with `pip -V`

- When using a virtualenv, you must source the `venv/bin/activate` script each time you start a new shell, otherwise the installed Python packages will not be available
- If using a Debian based Linux distro, and the _venv_ Python library is not found or if there is an error about missing _ensurepip_, you will have to apt install `python3-venv` first

Install the python-blockchain package from the current directory\
`pip install .`
